This application wouldn't be possible without the work of others. The (likely incomplete) list below contains the work `Docnet` is based on / builds upon. 

* [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/). `Docnet` borrows a great deal from `MkDocs`: the theme css `Docnet` uses is based on a cleaned up version of their `Readthedocs` theme, as well as the javascript based search is from MkDocs. 
* [MarkdownSharp](https://github.com/KyleGobel/MarkdownSharp-GithubCodeBlocks). The markdown parser is an extended version of the `MarkdownSharp` parser from StackExchange with the extensions added by Kyle Gobel. 
* [Json.NET](http://www.newtonsoft.com/json). The reading/writing of json files is important for `Docnet` and it uses Json.NET for that.
