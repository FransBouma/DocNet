# DocNet

DocNet is a static site generator, mainly meant for user documentation, using markdown files to build the content.

To learn more about DocNet, please visit its own documentation site, created with `Docnet` itself at:
[https://fransbouma.github.io/DocNet/](https://fransbouma.github.io/DocNet/)

The [gh-pages](https://github.com/FransBouma/DocNet/tree/gh-pages) branch contains the source of the documentation site, which can be a great starting point to see how things are done as well.

Happy documenting!
